# Practice scripts.
This repo contains all the smalls scripts I make for the sake of learning. It may contain stuff that's literally broken or half made, so don't take it much seriously.

Other small scripts or ones that I actually want to save can be seen on my [gist](https://gist.github.com/Nsttt).
